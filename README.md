# Netflix-Recommendation-System
## Author - Hari Vigneshwaran S

This is a flask based web-app which can be used to get recommendations for a tv-show/movie, the app recommends a list of media according to the user choice input. 

**If you are looking to skim over the project without going into too much detail, you can easily access it through [_here_](https://nbviewer.org/github/SHariVigneshwaran/Netflix-Recommendation-WebApp/blob/master/Netflix-Recommendation-System.ipynb).**

The dataset I will be using is from www.kaggle.com.

I have also provided the direct link below if you wish to view the dataset I used to build this recommendation system.

I have downloaded the dataset and pushed along with the code in this repo.

This project helps you to understand Recommendation System and working of flask in a better way. Hope you all like this webapp. Cheers <3
